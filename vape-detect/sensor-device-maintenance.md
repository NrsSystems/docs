The VapeDetect sensor device should be cleaned at least once a year. To clean it, remove the sensor from the sampling and exhaust tubes by turning both lock nuts counterclockwise. Once they are loose, carefully pull the sensor device away from the tubes.

Once the sensor assembly is removed from the tubes, the tubes can be cleaned by using a small can of air to blow them out. The exhaust tube can be cleaned by blowing air into the tube. Note that the sampling tube needs to be cleaned a little more carefully because there is a cap at the end of the sampling tube which is required for proper operation. Blow the air in slowly to clean out any dust or other particles. Donâ€™t blow a strong stream of air through the sampling tube.

To clean the device itself, carefully remove the four screws holding the cover on and remove the cover. Using compressed air, lightly blow around the sensing board to remove any dust or other particles. Make sure you blow under the board and into the round opening in the side of the particle sensor (very lightly). 

Once the sensor board is clean, carefully replace the cover and screws. Mount the sensor back on the sampling and exhaust tubes, making certain that the sampling tube is connected to the correct coupler. The sticker on the device has arrows indicating the correct direction of the flow of air through the sensor. Please make sure the sensor is oriented correctly on the sampling tube so the air flows through it correctly. You can also check by looking at the side of the device with the connectors and LED. With the RJ-45 jack on the bottom, the inlet side of the device is to the left. Once the device is mated and fully seated onto the sampling tubes, turn the coupler nuts clockwise to lock the device in place.
