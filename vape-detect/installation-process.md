abstract: This page explains how to physically install your VapeDetect duct-mounted or standalone sensor.

See the [Device Installation and Setup Requirements page](installation-reqs.md) before starting the installation process for important information on the [tools required](installation-reqs.md#tools-required), [choosing the location of your device](installation-reqs.md#choosing-the-location), and [modifying the sampling tubes](installation-reqs.md#modifying-the-sampling-tubes).

## Device placement
The sensor should be installed as close to the source of air as possible—the closer the sampling tube is to the air vent, the better. Although the sensor can be installed farther back in the vent when needed—for example, if it cannot physically fit toward the front because of the vent construction—the farther away it is from the air source, the less accurate the readings will be. The sensor will be attached to the outside of the duct, with its sampling and exhaust tubes extending into the duct through two 7/8” holes drilled 3” apart, in line with the airflow.

## Installation 
Once the tubes are cut to size and inserted into the sensor, the sensor can be installed. Two holes need to be drilled in the vent box or tube, 3” apart and in line with the airflow. The hole closest to the airflow should be located so that it is approximately 2” to 4” from the air vent. Use a 7/8” hole saw to drill the holes.

Insert the sensor tubes through the holes, making sure the sampling tube is first in line with the airflow. (So, the front or curved end of the sensor should be closest to the vent.) Push the sensor until the body is in contact with the duct and secure it with the two supplied sheet metal screws. The sensor is designed to fit against either square or round ducting. 

Once the sensor is securely attached to the duct, plug the POE network cable into the sensor. The sensor will power on and connect to our service. Once the LED turns solid white, the sensor is connected to our service and is functioning properly.

## Startup
When the network cable from the sensor is plugged into a POE switch, the device will get power and will start.
1.	When first plugged in, the LED will turn blue and then off to indicate the device is powering on.
2.	The LED will flash yellow rapidly to indicate sensor calibration. The sensors need time to warm up, so if the device has not been powered recently, this could take a while.
3.	The LED will flash purple to indicate the device is trying to connect to the local network.
4.	The LED will flash yellow again, more slowly (once every half second), to indicate the device is establishing a connection to the service.
5.	Finally the LED will turn solid white to indicate the device has begun normal operation.
