title: Account Manager 
abstract: The Account Manager page is the default landing page for all users, and also allows company administrators to add a new company account, change a company's account information, and view or edit their administrator profile.
---
*Jump to how to [add a company account](account-manager.md#add-a-company-account), [change a company's account information](account-manager.md#change-a-companys-account-information), or [view or edit your administrator profile](account-manager.md#view-or-edit-your-administrator-profile).*

Once you have an account, log in with your email address as username and the password you set. The Account Manager page will load, showing you tiles for the organizations associated with your account—by default one, possibly more. 
 
To continue, select **Manage** in the appropriate tile for your company. This will take you to the dashboard for that company. See the [Dashboard section](dashboard.md) for more information about the dashboard and the general interface of the XSPONSE site.

Additionally, from this page company account administrators can add new companies, edit the information for their companies, and view and edit their personal profile information.

## Add a company account
To create a new company account, select **Add an Account** in the upper right of the main pane. This will open a separate page allowing you to fill out the information for the new organization. You can also upload an image file of the organization’s logo. All “image” MIME file types are supported, and the file may be up to 1 MB in size. (This logo will appear in the company’s tile on the Account Manager page and can be used in the screensaver feature of XSPONSE Digital Displays.) Select **Submit** to save the new organization account. Select **Account Manager** in the navigation pane to go back to the Account Manager page without saving any changes.

## Change a company’s account information
To change the information for a company, select the **Accounts** icon in the top right of the page to show the menu of companies you can manage and select the **Adjust** (gear) icon next to a company name. This will open a separate page allowing you to update the organization’s information. Select **Submit** to save the changes. (Note that this will take you to the company dashboard rather than the Account Manager page; see the [Dashboard section](dashboard.md) for more information.) Once you have submitted the changes, you can always select the **Manage all Accounts** link in the Accounts menu to return to the Account Manager page. To go back to the Account Manager page without saving any changes, in the top right corner select the **Accounts** icon and then select the **Manage all Accounts** link.

## View or edit your administrator profile
To view or edit your administrator profile, select the **User** icon in the top right of the page and select the **Profile** link in the menu. This will open a new page with your personal account information, including your first and last name, time zone, and a menu to select your default company account; it also has a link to change your password. Select **Update** to save your changes and return to the Account Manager page. Select **Account Manager** in the navigation pane to go back to the Account Manager page without saving any changes.
