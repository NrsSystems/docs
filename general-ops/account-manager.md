title: Account Manager 
abstract: The Account Manager pane allows administrators to add a new company account or change a company's account information. Selecting the Manage All Accounts link in the Accounts menu will take you to the Account Manager pane. It is also the default landing page for administrators or users who have more than one company associated with their accounts.

*Jump to how to [add a company account](account-manager.md#add-a-company-account), [change a company's account information](account-manager.md#change-a-companys-account-information), or [view or edit your profile](account-manager.md#view-or-edit-your-profile).*

The Account Manager pane shows tiles for the organizations associated with your account—by default one, possibly more. An individual user whose XSPONSE account is not associated with a company will see instead their account's email address listed in a tile.

Additionally, the user Profile pane is associated with the Account Manager pane, although it can be accessed through the User menu from anywhere on the site. The Profile pane allows you to manage some settings for your personal account, including changing your password and linking an ArtDrive or Google Photos account to your XSPONSE account. See the [View or edit your profile](account-manager.md#view-or-edit-your-profile) section later on this page for more information.

To continue, select **Manage** in the appropriate tile for your company or account. This will take you to the dashboard for that company. See the [Dashboard page](dashboard.md) for more information about the dashboard and see the [XSPONSE Site Overview page](site-overview.md) for more information on the general interface of the XSPONSE site.

From this pane, company account administrators can add new companies and edit the information for their companies. 

## Add a company account
To create a new company account, select **Add an Account** in the upper right of the main pane. This will open a separate pane allowing you to fill out the information for the new organization. You can also upload an image file of the organization’s logo. All “image” MIME file types are supported, and the file may be up to 1 MB in size. (This logo will appear in the company’s tile on the Account Manager pane and can be used in the screensaver feature of XSPONSE Digital Displays.) Select **Submit** to save the new organization account. Select **Account Manager** in the navigation pane to go back to the Account Manager pane without saving any changes.

## Change a company’s account information
To change the information for a company, select the **Accounts** icon in the top right of the pane to show the menu of companies you can manage and select the **Adjust** (gear) icon next to a company name. This will open a separate pane allowing you to update the organization’s information. Select **Submit** to save the changes. (Note that this will take you to the company dashboard rather than the Account Manager pane; see the [Dashboard page](dashboard.md) for more information.) Once you have submitted the changes, you can always select the **Manage all Accounts** link in the Accounts menu to return to the Account Manager pane. To go back to the Account Manager pane without saving any changes, in the top right corner select the **Accounts** icon and then select the **Manage all Accounts** link.

## View or edit your profile
To view or edit your profile, select the **User** icon in the top right of the pane and select the **Profile** link in the menu. This will open a new pane with your personal account information, including your first and last name, time zone, and a list to select your default company account if you have more than one. Select **Update** to save your changes to these fields.

Select **Change Password** to change your password. This will open a new webpage with a form to enter your old password and enter and confirm your new password; once you have done so, select **Change Password** to make the change and return to the Profile pane. Use the Back button in your browser to return to the Profile pane without saving any changes.

Also in the Profile pane, you can link an ArtDrive account or a Google Photos account to your XSPONSE account, which enables you to use those accounts as image sources for a Digital Displays view. (See the [Views Management page](../digital-displays/views-management.md) for more information on views.) The process to link either account is similar. Select **Connect to ArtDrive** or **Connect to Google Photos**, which will open a sign-in page for the account. Sign in to your ArtDrive or Google account, and on the next page select **Authorize** or **Allow** to confirm that you want to provide xsponse.com access to your ArtDrive galleries or Google Photos library. Once you authorize the connection, your XSPONSE profile pane will reload with ArtDrive or Google Photos listed as a linked account. To remove either, select **Disconnect _[service]_ Account**. 

Once you have finished viewing or editing your profile, select **Account Manager** in the navigation pane to go back to the Account Manager pane, or select the **Accounts** menu in the top right of the pane and select the account you want to return to the dashboard.
