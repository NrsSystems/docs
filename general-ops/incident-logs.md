Each time a VapeDetect sensor detects an event and triggers an action plan, the information is recorded in the incident logs. The table shows the incidents by the device that was triggered, along with the time the event occurred, whether the action plan is active or not, and the type of incident. 

To view the details of an incident, select the **Information** button in the row for that incident. This will open a separate page with the incident report. The information includes the source device, which action plan was triggered, whether the action plan is currently active, the trigger context, and a table of the actions taken and the current status of each.

Select the **Device Attributes** link under the Trigger Context heading to see a floating box with the device attributes. Select the main window outside the box to dismiss it and return to the incident report. 

In the actions table, select the **Information** button in the row for an action to view details about that action. Select the main window outside the box to dismiss it and return to the incident report.

Select the **Logs** link in the upper right of the incident report page to return to the Incident Logs page. 

To go back to the Action Plans management page, select the **Action Plans** link in the upper right of this page or in the navigation pane.
