Through device toggle groups, you can set one or more relay consoles to activate when one or more button consoles are triggered. For example, when a single XSPONSE button is pressed to indicate an emergency, it could trigger relays that activate lights and sirens in multiple locations.

Select **Delete** to delete the toggle group. Select **Back** to go back to the Device Toggle Groups management pane without deleting the toggle group.
