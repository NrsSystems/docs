The table shows the contacts by name, along with their email address and phone number.

## Add a contact
To add a contact, select **Create Contact** at the top right of the page. This will open a separate page allowing you to provide the name, email address, and phone number for the contact. (Note: the Tags field functionality is not currently implemented, and will be added in a future update.) Select **Submit** to save the new contact. Select the **Contacts** link in the upper right of the page (or in the navigation pane) to go back to the Contacts management page without saving the contact.

## Edit a contact
To edit a contact, select the **Edit** icon in the contacts table. This will open a separate page allowing you to change the contact information. Once changes are made, select **Submit** to accept the changes. Select the **Contacts** link in the upper right of the page (or in the navigation pane) to go back to the Contacts management page without saving the contact.

## Delete a contact
To delete a contact, select the **Delete** icon in the contacts table. This will open a separate page asking you to confirm contact deletion. Select **Delete** to delete the contact. Select **Cancel** to go back to the Contacts management page without deleting the sound.
