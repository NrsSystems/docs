title: Getting Started
abstract: This page explains how to set up accounts for your administrator and other users.
---
To start, you will need to have at least one administrator user account. The administratorâ€™s role is to manage the other user accounts on the system. (Administrators can also perform all the other tasks that regular users can do.) If no one is set up as an administrator, please contact your installer to get an administrator account created. They will send you an email with a link to the XSPONSE site, where you will be required to set a password for your new account, using your email address as the username. Once you have set a password, you will be redirected to log in to the site.

Once the administrator account is created, the administrator can send invitations to other employees to add them to the system. These invitations work in the same fashion, providing a link to the XSPONSE site where the employee will be required to set a password and then be redirected to log in. You should have your administrator create all the other new accounts within an organization, as the administrator will have the best understanding of how your company should be using the system. See the [Users page](users-management.md) for more information.

The administrator account has the ability to view and edit their own profile information. See the [Account Manager page](account-manager.md) for more information.
