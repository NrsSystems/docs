title: Getting Started
abstract: This page explains how to set up XSPONSE service accounts for your administrator and other users.
---
To start using the XSPONSE service, you will need to have at least one administrator user account. The administratorâ€™s role is to manage the other user accounts on the system. (Administrators can also perform all the other tasks that regular users can do.) If no one is set up as an administrator, please contact your installer to get an administrator account created. They will send you (the designated administrator) an email with a link to the XSPONSE site to register. Once the administrator account is created, the administrator can send invitations to other employees to add them to the system. These invitations work in the same fashion, providing a link to the XSPONSE site to register their account. You should have your administrator create all the other new accounts within an organization, as the administrator will have the best understanding of how your company should be using the system. See the [Users Management page](users-management.md) for more information.

For both administrators and regular users, the registration process on the [XSPONSE site](https://manage.xsponse.com) is the same. Select **Sign up**. In the new window, enter your first name, last name, email address, and password (following the guidelines), then select **Sign Up** to create your account. This will return you to the Login page with the message "Your account has been created. Please Login." Enter your email address and password and select **Login**. 

The first time you log in to your new account, you will need to read through and accept the Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service. (On both pages, you may also choose to select **Logout** if you are not prepared to complete this process at the time, but you will have to read and accept the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service when you return to login and complete the process.)

Once you have accepted both the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, the XSPONSE service dashboard will appear. The dashboard is the home page for managing your XSPONSE service and devices. For full information on the XSPONSE website interface and the dashboard, see the [XSPONSE Site Overview page](site-overview.md) and the [Dashboard page](dashboard.md).

Both administrators and users can view and edit their own profile information, including changing their password. See the [Account Manager page](account-manager.md) for more information.
