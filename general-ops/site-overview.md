title: XSPONSE Site Overview
abstract: The XSPONSE service is managed through the XSPONSE website, which provides a dashboard through which you can access various components relevant to your devices. The site features a consistent look and feel, with every page providing the same base functions, to make navigation easier.
---
The main pane shows the relevant content for your current page. See the [Dashboard section](dashboard.md) for more information.

At the upper right above the main pane on every page throughout the site are three icons: a bell for alerts, a building for your company accounts, and a person for your user account.

-	Select the **Alerts** icon to show the alerts for your account in descending order by time (the most recent will be at the top of the menu). The account alerts notify you when one of your associated devices is disconnected. Select an alert to go to the management page for that device. The alerts list is populated by company account and will be empty when you are viewing the Account Manager page. See the help section for your devices for more information.
-	Select the **Accounts** icon to show the menu of companies you have access to—by default your own and, when applicable, additional ones. Select an entry from this menu to go directly to that company’s dashboard. Administrators can select the **Adjust** (gear) icon next to a company name in this menu to go to the Edit Company page for that company. Select the **Manage all Accounts** link to go to the Account Manager page. See the [Account Manager section](account-manager.md) for more information.
-	Select the **User** icon to show a menu with options to view and edit your profile, access the support page, and log out. The **Profile** option is only available to administrator accounts. The **Support** option appears when you are viewing the dashboard for a particular company account and will not be visible from the Account Manager page. See the [Account Manager section](account-manager.md) for more information.

The navigation pane also appears throughout the site along the left side, showing links to pages for managing your XSPONSE devices and functions, as well as company contacts and users. When you first log in, you will arrive at the Account Manager page, which will be the only link visible in the navigation pane. (See the [Account Manager section](account-manager.md) for more information.) Once you have chosen a company to manage, you will arrive at the dashboard for that company, and the following links will appear in the navigation pane.
-	Select the **Dashboard** link to go back to the dashboard for your company.
-	Select the **Displays** link to expand the submenu for Digital Displays options—Sounds, Devices, Views, Playlists, and Schedules—then select one of these links to go to the relevant management page. Selecting Displays a second time will collapse this submenu. See the Digital Displays section for more information.
-	Select the **Button Consoles** link to go to the Button Consoles management page. See the Button Consoles section for more information.
-	Select the **VapeDetect** link to go to the VapeDetect sensor management page. See the VapeDetect section for more information.
-	Select the **Relay Consoles** link to go to the Relay Consoles management page. See the Relay Consoles section for more information.
-	Select the **Action Plans** link to go to the Action Plans management page. See the [Action Plans section](action-plans.md) for more information.
-	Select the **Contacts** link to go to the Contacts management page. See the [Contacts section](contacts-management.md) for more information.
-	Select the **Users** link to go to the Users management page. This link will only appear for your company administrator, and other users will not see it. See the [Users section](users-management.md) for more information.
