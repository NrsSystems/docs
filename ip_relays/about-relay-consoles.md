title: About IP Relay Consoles
abstract: This page describes the basic information about the XSPONSE IP Relay Consoles service and devices.

Before you get started, it is important to understand how the system is designed. We have three main components: IP relay consoles, action plans, and contacts. 
- _IP relay consoles_ are cloud-connected devices that enable analog equipment to become remotely controlled via digital networks. You must associate each relay console with your XSPONSE account before you can use it. See the [IP Relay Consoles Management page](relay-consoles-management.md) for more information.
- An _action plan_ is a set of one or more actions that happen automatically in response to a trigger event, such as a panic button sending an alert. These actions can include sending email or SMS, activating a third-party API, or posting information on an associated XSPONSE Digital Display device. An action plan can also be set to a schedule. See the [Action Plans page](../general-ops/action-plans.md) for more information. 
- A _contact_ is a person listed in the service as a potential recipient of messages in response to an action plan being triggered. Contacts do not need to be users of the XSPONSE service. See the [Contacts Management page](../general-ops/contacts-management.md) for more information.

IP relay consoles can be connected to virtually any direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC) control circuitry and act as a controller by opening or closing a circuit. Each relay console supports up to two analog connections\*. The relay console is connected by Power-over-Ethernet network cables to the XSPONSE service via the internet, enabling you to remotely control equipment, such as starting and stopping machinery, controlling door locks and gates, or turning lights on and off. Each of the two relay connections can be configured through multiple action plans allowing the administrator to open, close, or toggle the relay when a certain condition occurs. The relay can also be called by an open and secure API.

You manage your XSPONSE service through the XSPONSE website, which provides a dashboard through which you can access each of these components. The site features a consistent look and feel, with every page providing the same base functions, to make navigation easier. See the [XSPONSE Site Overview page](../general-ops/site-overview.md) and the [Dashboard page](../general-ops/dashboard.md) for more information.

\*Two single-pole, double-throw (SPDT) relays supporting up to 10 amps at 250V AC or 10 amps at 30V DC.
