The Displays management page allows a user to [link](displays-management.md#add-a-display), [edit](displays-management.md#edit-a-display), [reboot (restart)](displays-management.md#restart-a-display), or [remove (delete)](displays-management.md#delete-a-display) a display. The table shows the display names/descriptions, the version of code each is running, and when the service last received a signal from each display (“last seen”).
When a display device starts, it checks the XSPONSE system to see whether it is associated with an account. If the display is not associated with an account, it will show a blue screen with the website address for activation (v2.nrsmercury.com) and an activation code. Entering that code into the Link a Display page accessed through the Displays management page (as described next) will associate the display with your account. Once the display is associated with your account, you can set it to show a specific view, run a playlist, or run a schedule. See the [Views section](views-management.md), [Playlists section](playlists-management.md), and [Schedules section](schedules-management.md) for more information.

## Add a display
To add a display, select **Link a Display** at the top right of the page. This will open a separate page asking you to enter the activation code shown on the display. Enter the code and select **Submit**. A new page will open asking you to give the device a description, select the time zone for the display, set its orientation (landscape or portrait—you can also flip the display depending on how it is set up), and set the content to show—a view, playlist, or schedule. Once you have set these options, select **Submit** to accept the settings. To go back to the Displays management page without linking a device, select **Cancel**.
 
## Edit a display
To edit a display, select the **Edit** icon in the displays table. This will open a separate page allowing you to edit the display description, time zone, orientation, and content. Once changes are made, select **Submit** to accept the changes. Select **Cancel** to go back to the Displays management page without saving any changes.

## Restart a display
To restart a display, select the **Restart** icon in the displays table. This will open a separate page asking you to confirm that you want to restart that display. Select **Reboot** to restart the display. Select **Cancel** to go back to the Displays management page without restarting the display.

## Delete a display
To remove a display, select the **Delete** icon in the displays table. This will open a separate page asking you to confirm display deletion. Select **Delete** to delete the display. Select **Cancel** to go back to the Displays management page without deleting the display.
