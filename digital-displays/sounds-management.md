*Jump to how to [add](sounds-management.md#add-a-sound), [edit](sounds-management.md#edit-a-sound), or [delete](sounds-management.md#delete-a-sound) the sounds.*
 
Certain views allow you to play a sound on a display. For example, in the countdown timer, you can program the display to play specific sounds during the countdown. See the [Views Management page](views-management.md) for more information. The base service contains several sounds that we have created and provide free of charge. The Sounds table shows the available sounds by description (name). You can delete or edit these sounds if you wish, as well as add new sounds. XSPONSE supports .wav and .mp3 file types, with a size limit of 5 MB per file.
