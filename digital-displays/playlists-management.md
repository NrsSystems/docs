*Jump to how to [add](playlists-management.md#add-a-playlist), [edit](playlists-management.md#edit-a-playlist), [copy](playlists-management.md#copy-a-playlist), or [delete](playlists-management.md#delete-a-playlist) a playlist.*

Playlists allow you to choose multiple views to show in a particular order and duration on a display. See the [Views section](views-management.md) for more information. Schedules can use playlists to show those views on one or more display on a weekly basis or for special one-time events. See the [Schedules section](schedules-management.md) for more information. 

The table shows the playlists by description (name), along with the number of views used in the playlist.

## Add a playlist
To add a playlist, select **Create Playlist** at the top right of the page. This will open a separate page allowing you to create a playlist. Set the parameters for your playlist:

_Description:_ Enter a descriptive name for the playlist in the Description field. 

_Content:_ Content can be added to the playlist by adding rows. The first row is shown by default. To add more content to a playlist, select **Add row** at the bottom, which will add a new row to the table. To select content, select the **down arrow** in the Content column to see a list of playlists and views. Select the one you would like to show. 

_Duration:_ If you want to set a duration, select the **check box** in the Duration column and enter a duration in hours, minutes, and seconds. 
> **Note:** If you select a view that doesn’t scroll (such as an image or a website with no scrolling), you must select the **check box** in the Duration column and set a duration. If your playlist runs until it gets to a certain image and then just stops, it is because the view doesn’t scroll or play and no duration was set. We are planning to address this in a future release.

_Order:_ The Order column shows the ordering of the content in the playlist. This parameter is set automatically when you create the playlist, and will update if you change the order while editing the playlist.

_Sort:_ The icon in the Sort column allows you to drag and drop rows so you can reorder the content in the playlist easily. 

_Disabled:_ Select the **check box** in the Disabled column to prevent that content from appearing in the playlist—use this setting if you want to temporarily turn content off rather than deleting it and then adding it back later. 

_Remove:_ Select the icon in the Remove column to delete a row. This will open a new page asking you to confirm the deletion of the row. Deleting a row permanently deletes the content from the playlist. 

## Edit a playlist
To edit a playlist, select the **Edit** icon in the playlist table. This will open a separate page allowing you to edit the contents of the playlist. Once changes are made, select **Submit** to accept the changes. Select **Cancel** to go back to the Playlists management page without saving any changes.

## Copy a playlist
To copy a playlist, select the **Copy** icon in the playlist table. This will open a separate page allowing you to provide a new description for the copy of the playlist. Once the new description is entered, select **Submit** to accept the changes. Select **Cancel** to go back to the Playlists management page without saving any changes.

## Delete a playlist
To delete a playlist, select the **Delete** icon in the playlist table. This will open a separate window asking you to confirm playlist deletion. Select **Delete** to delete the playlist. Select **Cancel** to go back to the Playlists management page without deleting the playlist.
