The scheduling feature enables you to create a schedule for one or more displays that will be repeated every week. (See the [Displays Management page](displays-management.md) for how to set a display to use a schedule.) The schedule does not allow for overlapping entries, so you can have only one piece of content per time period—for example, if a video is scheduled to play every Friday from noon to 3 PM, you cannot also schedule a website to show on the same display starting at 2 PM every Friday. One-time special events that do not repeat can also be added to a schedule, and they will override the usual scheduled content during that time period on that occasion. (See [Special Events](schedules-management.md#special-events) later on this page for more information.)

The schedules table shows the schedules by description (name), along with the number of associated events.

## Add a schedule
To add a schedule, select **Create Schedule** at the top right of the pane. This will open a separate pane where you can provide a description of the schedule and select the screensaver. The screensaver allows you to show a simple image when the display isn’t active (no content is selected for the time period). If you do not select anything, the display will default to showing the NRS/XSPONSE logo. If you select the “Bouncing Logo,” the display will show the image you have selected for the company logo in the company setup screen (see the [Dashboard page](general-ops/dashboard.md) for more information). We are planning to add other screensaver options in the future.

To create an entry in the schedule, select the timeslot on the calendar for the time when you want the playlist or view to start. (Note that although the timeslots by default start at every half-hour, you can set the start and end times to any minute of the hour.) In the new window that appears, select the content you want to show (a playlist or view), select a specific start time (if desired), select the end time, and select the days of the week you want to show this content. When you select the down arrow, the days of the week will appear. You can use the buttons at the top to select all or deselect all the days. Select a day of the week to select or deselect it individually. Once you have selected the content, end time, and days of week, select **Submit** (or the **X** in the upper-right corner) to close the window and save the schedule entry. Select **Cancel** to close the event window without saving it. Select **Remove** to delete a saved event.

Once you have added all the events you want to a schedule, select **Submit** to finish creating your new schedule. Select **Cancel** to go back to the Schedules management pane without creating a schedule.

## Edit a schedule
To edit a schedule, select the **Edit** icon in the schedules table. This will open a separate pane allowing you to edit the schedule. Once changes are made, select **Submit** to accept the changes. Select **Cancel** to go back to the Schedules management pane without saving any changes.

## Copy a schedule
To copy a schedule, select the **Copy** icon in the schedules table. This will open a separate pane allowing you to enter a description for the copied schedule. Once changes are made, select **Submit** to accept the copied schedule. Select **Cancel** to go back to the Schedules management pane without saving any changes.

## Delete a schedule
To delete a schedule, select the **Delete** icon in the schedules table. This will open a separate pane asking you to confirm schedule deletion. Select **Delete** to delete the schedule. Select **Cancel** to go back to the Schedules management pane without deleting the schedule.

## Special Events
A special event is a one-time event when the content you select will be displayed instead of what is shown on the schedule. Special events will appear in the schedule but only during the week for which they are scheduled. Once the date for a special event has passed, the special event is deleted and can no longer be viewed or edited.
 
Note that when you create or edit a special event, once you have finished with the Special Events pane, you will also need to select **Submit** at the bottom of the schedule pane to save your changes to the overall schedule.

### Add a special event
To add a special event to an existing schedule, select the **Edit** icon in the schedules table for that schedule. Or to create a new schedule for your special event, on the Schedules management pane, select **Create Schedule** at the top right of the pane. In either case, select **Special Events** on the right side of the screen, which will expand the Special Events pane. Upcoming special events that have been created will be listed in this pane. Select **Create special event** to open a new window to create the one-time event. You can select the content to show and enter the date, start time, and end time for the event. Once the entries are made, select **Submit** to accept the changes. Select **Cancel** to go back to the Special Events pane without saving any changes. Select the double-arrow (**>>**) button at the right of the screen to collapse the Special Events pane and go back to the Create Schedule pane. Once you have finished adding special events, select **Submit** to save the new schedule or changes to an existing schedule. Select **Cancel** to go back to the Schedules management pane without saving any changes.

### Edit or delete a special event
You can edit special events while on the Create/Update Schedule pane by opening the Special Events pane and selecting them, which will open the “Edit event on schedule” window. The content, date, and start and end times can be changed. Once changes are made, select **Submit** to save the changes. Select **Remove** to delete the special event from the schedule. (Note that if you select **Remove** to delete a special event, it will remain listed in the Special Events pane until you select **Submit** to save the changes to the schedule.) Select **Cancel** to go back to the Special Events pane without saving any changes. Select the double-arrow (**>>**) button at the right of the screen to collapse the Special Events pane and go back to the Create/Update Schedule pane. If you have made any changes to a special event, select **Submit** to save the schedule with the changes. Select **Cancel** to go back to the Schedules management pane without saving any changes.
