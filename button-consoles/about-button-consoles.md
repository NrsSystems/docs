abstract: This page describes the basic information about the XSPONSE Button Consoles service and devices.

Before you get started, it is important to understand how the system is designed. We have three main components: button consoles, action plans, and contacts. 
- _Button consoles_ are cloud-connected button devices that can be configured for a variety of safety and security uses. You must associate each button console with your XSPONSE account before you can use it. See the [Button Consoles Management page](button-consoles-management.md) for more information.
- An _action plan_ is a set of one or more actions that happen automatically in response to a trigger event, such as a button console sending an alert. These actions can include sending email or SMS, activating a third-party API, or posting information on an associated XSPONSE Digital Display device. See the [Action Plans page](../general-ops/action-plans.md) for more information. 
- A _contact_ is a person listed in the service as a potential recipient of messages in response to an action plan being triggered. Contacts do not need to be users of the XSPONSE service. See the [Contacts Management page](../general-ops/contacts-management.md) for more information.

Button consoles are connected by Power-over-Ethernet network cables to the XSPONSE service via the internet, enabling you to configure them for a variety of purposes. Through action plans which determine what happens when the button is pressed, the buttons can summon help, trigger an alarm or security system, automatically shut down machinery, or display information and warnings on XSPONSE Digital Displaysâ€”even all of these actions in one plan.

You manage your XSPONSE service through the XSPONSE website, which provides a dashboard through which you can access each of these components. The site features a consistent look and feel, with every page providing the same base functions, to make navigation easier. See the [XSPONSE Site Overview page](../general-ops/site-overview.md) and the [Dashboard page](../general-ops/dashboard.md) for more information.
